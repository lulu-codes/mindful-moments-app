# DEV1001 T1A2 - Programming Project: "Mindful Moments" App

## Project Overview:

This is my individual programming project to demonstrate my skills as a Student Developer to design and build a functional command-line interface (CLI) application using the Python programming language.

The application showcases my abilities and skills to develop and implement the use of key programming principles, structures and apply appropriate use of code styles and conventions.

### Key concepts demonstrated in this project include:

- Writing and using functions and classes
- Applying of Python language features including appropriate use of syntax and structures
- Handling of inputs and outputs for a functional user experience
- Applying DRY coding coding principles and use of reusable functions
- Approporiate use of code styles and conventions in Python
- Documentation including user help guide and instructions on how to use application
- Implementing control structures to manage control flow
- Applying error handling to manage exceptions and errors
- Using third-party libraries and use of modules and functions
- Using file handling, including reading and writing files/data to JSON


## Purpose of "Mindful Moments" App:

The "Mindful Moments" CLI app is designed to allow users to log and view their reflection journal entries about "Mindful Moments" to encourage users to reflect on their daily mood and wins and challenges of the day.
